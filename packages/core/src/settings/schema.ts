 * The user-settings schema — the policy half of the settings store. Rust

 *
 * Resilience contract (mirrors the frontmatter schema): a missing or invalid
 * value degrades to its default (`.catch`) instead of failing the whole load,
 * and unknown keys are preserved (`.passthrough`) so a document written by a
 * newer app version round-trips through an older one without losing fields.
