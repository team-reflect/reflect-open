# Reflect Design System

> **Reflect** — *"A beautifully minimalist note-taking app designed to mirror the way you think."*
> Think better with Reflect. Never miss a note, idea or connection.

This is a design system distilled from Reflect's real production source. Use it to
build well-branded Reflect interfaces and assets — product screens, marketing pages,
slides, prototypes — that look and feel like the real thing.

## What Reflect is

Reflect is a fast, minimalist, **networked** note-taking app. It is a writing tool
first: the interface gets out of the way so your prose is the hero. Its defining
ideas are:

- **Daily notes** — an infinite, date-stamped journal is the home surface.
- **Networked thought / backlinks** — `[[wiki-style]]` links between notes form a
  graph (a "second brain"). The brand mark *is* that graph.
- **Frictionless capture** — fast sync, instant search (`⌘K`), audio notes, web
  clipper, Kindle highlights.
- **A native AI assistant** — GPT-4 + Whisper for transcription, outlining, rewriting,
  and acting as a "thought partner."
- **Privacy** — end-to-end encrypted. "No one else can read them (not even us)."
- **Everywhere** — Mac, Windows, iOS, web; online or offline; real-time synced.

Pricing is famously simple: **one plan, one price — $10/month** (billed annually),
with a 14-day free trial.

It is an **indie product** (Reflect App, LLC; founder Alex MacCaw / @maccaw), with a
warm, slightly playful voice — *"making a jolly good note-taking app."*

### Two surfaces, one purple soul
Reflect presents two distinct visual worlds that share a brand color:

1. **The App** — a calm, near-white (or deep-navy dark-mode) productivity canvas.
   Dense, quiet chrome; **indigo `#4F46E5`** as the only saturated accent; everything
   else cool grey. Built on a shadcn-style HSL token set.
2. **The Marketing Site** — a near-black *"deep space"* surface (`#030014`) lit by
   **purple radial glows** (`#712fff` / `#9465ff`), glassmorphic hairline borders, and
   oversized tight display type.

## CONTENT FUNDAMENTALS

**Voice — confident, calm, quietly clever.** Reflect speaks like a thoughtful maker,
not a marketing department. Sentences are short and declarative. There's dry wit
("making a jolly good note-taking app"; encryption "not even us") but never goofiness.

- **Person:** Speaks to **"you"** and **"your"** ("Give *your* brain superpowers",
  "Mirror the way *your* mind works"). The team is **"we / our"** ("We're everywhere",
  "Our mission is to improve the way people think").
- **Casing:** **Sentence case everywhere** — headings, buttons, menu items, labels.
  Never Title Case UI, never ALL CAPS (except tiny tracked section eyebrows like
  "Reflect AI", "Encryption", "Meetings" that label a marketing section).
- **Headlines** are aspirational and benefit-led, often imperative:
  *"Think better with Reflect."* · *"Give your brain superpowers."* ·
  *"Never lose information."* · *"Get more out of your meetings."*
- **Feature blurbs** are one tight line, lowercase-feeling, no period sometimes:
  *"Instantly sync your notes across devices"* · *"Form a graph of ideas with backlinked
  notes"* · *"Capture ideas on the go, online or offline."*
- **App chrome copy** is terse and literal: `Daily notes`, `All notes`, `Tasks`, `Map`,
  `Pinned notes`, `Search anything…`, `Preferences`, `Billing`, `Sign out`,
  `My Graph`. Placeholders use an ellipsis ("Search anything…", "Ask anything to AI…").
- **Buttons / CTAs:** verb-led and specific — `Start free trial`, `Start your 14-day
  trial`, `Take the course`, `See our values`, `Subscribe`. The recurring primary CTA
  is **"Start free trial" / "Start your 14-day trial."**
- **Emoji:** essentially **none** in product UI and almost none in marketing (a rare 🙏
  shows up only inside quoted user testimonials — never in Reflect's own voice).
- **Numbers/jargon:** minimal. Reflect avoids stat-slop; it names benefits ("Built for
  speed", "Frictionless search") rather than dumping metrics.
- **Vibe:** *minimalist, fast, trustworthy, a little magical.* Users describe it as
  "magic" and praise "the simplicity… is beautiful" — lean into calm restraint.

## VISUAL FOUNDATIONS

**Typeface.** One family: **Inter** (the variable "Inter 4.0" cut). Nothing else.
`--weight-medium (500)` is the workhorse for nav, buttons, titles and note titles;
body/editor prose is 400. Headings use **tight negative tracking** (`-0.02em`);
default UI uses Inter's slight optical setting (`-0.011em`).

**Type scale.** The app is a *writing tool*, so chrome text is deliberately **small**
(12–14px: section headers & shortcut hints at `2xs/12px`, note titles & labels at
`xs/13px`, buttons & menu items at `sm/14px`), and the user's prose is the largest
thing on screen (16px+). The marketing site inverts this with huge tight display
headings (`40–72px`).

**Color.**
- **App:** near-white canvas (`#fff` surfaces on a `#f8fafa` app bg) or deep-navy dark
  mode (`hsl(224 49% 8%)` ≈ `#0a0f1e`). Neutrals are **cool greys** (the "coolgray"
  ramp). **Indigo `#4F46E5` is the only saturated accent** — solid buttons, selected
  state, focus. Secondary actions use soft indigo (`#e0e7ff` bg / `#4338ca` text).
  Destructive is red-500. That's the whole palette — restraint is the point.
- **Site:** near-black `#030014` lit by **purple** — a soft radial glow
  (`rgba(148,101,255,.08)`) from top-center, `#712fff`/`#9465ff` accents, and hairline
  glass borders in `rgba(255,255,255,.08)`.

**Backgrounds.** App = flat solid fills, no gradients, no texture, no imagery behind
content. Site = the deep-space radial-glow gradient + glassmorphism (translucent fills
with `backdrop-blur`). The signature brand image is the **networked graph sphere**
(glowing purple nodes connected by arcs) — used as the app icon and hero motif. No
stock photography; product screenshots and the graph illustration carry imagery.

**Borders & dividers.** Hairlines do most of the structural work — `1px` borders in
`--coolgray-100` (V1's hairline; whisper-quiet), and the signature **`shadow-border-b`
/ `shadow-border-r`** (`0 1px 0 rgba(11,19,36,.05)`) for crisp 1px separators that
don't add weight. Inputs get a `rgba(11,19,36,.15)` outline. In dark/space mode,
borders drop to `rgba(255,255,255,.05–.08)`.

**Corner radii.** Gentle. Controls & cards = **8px** (`--radius-lg`, the house value);
the search field is a precise **7px**; tags/chips 4px; modals & glass panels 12–16px;
avatars, the graph color dot, and the marketing nav capsule are **fully round**.

**Shadows / elevation.** The app is **mostly flat** — borders carry hierarchy and
shadows appear only on *floating* things: inputs (`0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05)`),
popovers/menus, modals (`--shadow-pop`). The marketing buttons use an **inset purple
glow** (`inset 0 0 12px rgba(191,151,255,.24)`) rather than a drop shadow.

**Hover / press states.**
- *Menu items & list rows:* hover = a translucent grey wash (`bg-gray-200/50`, i.e.
  `rgba(229,231,235,.5)`; dark: `rgba(255,255,255,.03)`). Selected = same wash + the
  text shifts to `--text` (darker); in dark mode the wash drops and the selected
  label tints brand indigo instead.
- *Primary button:* hover **lightens** indigo-600 → indigo-500; focus = 2px indigo ring
  with offset; disabled = grey + `not-allowed`.
- *Touchable (mobile/list):* `active:opacity-70` — a quick opacity dip on press.
- *Site links:* color fade over `300ms` with the house easing.
- *White button:* hover shifts text → purple-500.

**Motion.** Short and calm — **no bounces, no spring.** Most UI transitions are
`100–150ms`. The site's signature easing is **`cubic-bezier(.6,.6,0,1)`** (a fast-out
curve) for color/opacity over `~300ms`. Reflect favors fades and subtle washes over
movement.

**Transparency & blur.** Used intentionally: glassmorphic chrome on the marketing site
(`backdrop-blur(16px)` headers, translucent nav capsule), and translucent hover/border
washes in the app dark mode. Not used decoratively in the light app.

**Layout rules.** App = a fixed-width left **sidebar (~260px)** on a sunken
(`coolgray-50`) surface + a flexible main editor column with a comfortable prose
measure (`max-w` ~46rem, optionally centered "semi-screen"). On desktop/Electron the
sidebar top-pads for the traffic-light window controls and is drag-region. Site =
centered `1296px` max container with generous `~96px` vertical section rhythm.

**Imagery vibe.** Cool and purple-leaning. The hero graph glows; product shots sit on
the dark space canvas. No warm tones, no grain, no photography of people (except small
circular testimonial avatars).

## ADDENDUM — V1 visual parity (June 2026)

The desktop app's chrome was restyled to match Reflect V1 exactly. That pass added
tokens and pinned down conventions that earlier drafts of this guide left implicit.
Everything below lives in `tokens/colors.css` / `tokens/typography.css` and is mapped
to Tailwind utilities in the desktop app's `@theme inline` block.

**New color tokens.**
- `--surface-inverse` — V1's near-black-blue selection fill (`hsl(222.2 47.4% 11.2%)`;
  dark mode: indigo-500). Used for the calendar's **selected-day square**: a 32×32px
  `radius-md` block behind the day number.
- `--text-on-inverse` — the near-white number on that square (`hsl(210 40% 98%)`,
  both modes), set **bold** when selected.
- `--surface-active` — *today's* calendar square when not selected: the same grey wash
  as hover (`rgba(229,231,235,.5)`; dark `rgba(55,65,81,.5)`).
- Light `--border` moved from `coolgray-200` → **`coolgray-100`** (V1's hairline).
  This is deliberate and global: V1 sets every divider at gray-100.
- Dark `--surface-hover` tightened to `rgba(255,255,255,.03)` and dark
  `--border-strong` to `rgba(255,255,255,.05)` — V1's exact dark-mode opacities.

**New shadow token.** `--shadow-app-input` — V1's signature five-layer stacked shadow
for the search field (`0 1px 0 -1px` … `0 3px 6px -3px`, each `rgba(0,0,0,.05)`;
`.10` in dark). It reads as one soft, crisp lift; pair it with the field's `7px`
radius and `--border-strong` outline.

**New type tokens.** `--font-shortcut` — `system-ui`-first stack so keyboard glyphs
(⌘ ⌥ ⇧) render cleanly. Shortcut hints come in two styles: **keycaps** (bordered
`<kbd>` chips, revealed on row hover) and **ghost** (borderless 12px uppercase text in
`--font-shortcut`, always visible — the search field's `⌘K`). The desktop app also
exposes `text-2xs` (12px) as a Tailwind utility; note the scale's intent — **13px
(`--text-xs`) for sidebar note rows and labels, 12px (`--text-2xs`) for section
headers, ghost hints, and meta**.

**Selection & navigation conventions pinned by the pass.**
- Sidebar nav rows: 24px icon + 14px medium label, `space-x-3`, `px-2.5 py-1.5`,
  `radius-md`. Selected = grey wash + `--text` in light; **transparent bg + indigo
  text** in dark.
- Sidebar section headers ("Pinned notes") are sentence case, 12px medium,
  `--text-muted`, `tracking-wide` — never uppercase.
- Context-sidebar sections collapse from a quiet sentence-case header whose chevron
  sits on the **right** and, while open, only appears on hover. No borders between
  sections, no count badges.
- The calendar is not a collapsible section: month title 14px semibold, prev /
  **jump-to-today (calendar glyph)** / next controls in `--text-muted`, weekday row
  with a bottom hairline, adjacent-month days at 20% opacity, and note-presence dots
  (`4px`, `--surface-inverse` at 50%) that fade in only while the pointer is over the
  calendar.
- Daily-note date headings render as the note's H1 (24px / 650 weight) in the format
  `Tue, June 9th, 2026` (`EEE, MMMM do, yyyy`; `dmy` swaps to `EEE, do MMMM, yyyy`),
  with **today's heading tinted brand indigo**.
- History back/forward chevrons live at the sidebar's top right as ghost icon buttons
  (`--text-muted`, hover wash, `opacity-50` when at the stack's edge).

## ICONOGRAPHY

Reflect ships a small set of **hand-built single-path SVG icons** living in
`components/icons/*` (e.g. `search-icon`, `pencil-icon` → Daily notes, `list-icon`
→ All notes, `check-icon` → Tasks, `map-icon` → Map, `calendar`, `mic`, `pin`,
`link`/`un-link`, `history`, `trash`, `chevron-left/right`, `help`, light/dark-mode).
They are **thin-stroke, ~1.5–2px, line-style** icons sized to match 14px chrome text,
inheriting `currentColor`.

- **No icon font, no emoji, no unicode glyphs as icons.** Icons are inline SVG.
- They are functional and minimal — a search magnifier, a pencil, a checkmark — never
  decorative or multicolor.
- The **brand mark** is the networked-graph sphere (`assets/reflect-app-icon.png` /
  `reflect-graph-hero.png`): glowing white nodes connected by purple arcs.

**Substitution for this system:** rather than re-tracing Reflect's private SVGs, this
kit uses **[Lucide](https://lucide.dev)** (loaded from CDN) — a thin-stroke line set
that matches Reflect's weight and style almost exactly (`search`, `pencil`, `list`,
`check`, `map`, `calendar`, `mic`, `pin`, `link`, `trash`, `history`, chevrons all map
1:1). **⚠️ Flagged substitution** — swap in the real `components/icons` SVGs if you
need pixel-exact brand icons. Set `stroke-width: 1.75` to match.

> **Update (V1 parity pass):** the desktop app now vendors the real V1 SVGs in
> `apps/desktop/src/components/icons/` — `pencil`, `list`, `search`, `help`, `pin`,
> `calendar`, `chevron-left/right`, plus a heroicons-traced `arrow-uturn-left` (the
> similar-notes return arrow, rendered flipped via `-scale-x-100`). All are 24×24
> `currentColor` fills (the magnifier is a 1.5px stroke). Prefer these over Lucide in
> product chrome; Lucide remains the stand-in for glyphs without a V1 equivalent
> (e.g. `square-pen` for New note, `settings`), sized 16px inside a 24px box.
